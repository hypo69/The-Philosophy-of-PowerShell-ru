<h2>The PowerShell Philosophy.</h2>
<h3><strong>Part 3: Navigating and managing the file system. Logical operators. Introduction to functions.</strong></h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/hypo69/1001-python-ru/blob/master/articles/%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%8F%20PowerShell/01.md">previous part</a>, we explored pipelines and abstract process objects.
Now let's apply our knowledge of the pipeline and objects to one of the most common tasks of a user or administrator — working with the file system.
In PowerShell, this work is built on the same principles: commands return objects that can be passed through the pipeline for further processing.</p>

<h3><strong>1. The concept of PowerShell Drives (PSDrives)</strong></h3>
<p>Before you start working with files, it is important to understand the concept of <strong>PowerShell Drives (PSDrives)</strong>. Unlike `cmd.exe`, where drives are only the letters `C:`, `D:`, and so on, in PowerShell, a "drive" is an abstraction for accessing any hierarchical data store.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">Get-PSDrive
</code></pre>
<p>The result will show not only physical drives, but also pseudo-drives:</p>

</table>
<p>This unification means that you can "go into" the registry (`Set-Location HKLM:`) and get a list of its keys with the same `Get-ChildItem` command that you use to get a list of files on the C: drive. This is an incredibly powerful concept.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples of working with different providers</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Certificate Store (Cert:)</strong>
Allows you to work with digital certificates as if they were files in folders.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Find all SSL certificates on the local machine that expire in the next 30 days.
```powershell
# Go to the local computer's certificate store
Set-Location Cert:\LocalMachine\My

# Find certificates where the expiration date is less than today + 30 days
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object { $_.NotAfter -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(30) } | Select-Object Subject, NotAfter, Thumbprint
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environment Variables (Env:)</strong>
Provides access to Windows environment variables (`%PATH%`, `%windir%`, etc.) as if they were files.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Get the path to the Windows system folder and add the path to `System32` to it.
```powershell
# Get the value of the windir variable
$windowsPath = (Get-Item Env:windir).Value
# Or simpler: $windowsPath = $env:windir

# Safely build the full path
$system32Path = Join-Path -Path $windowsPath -ChildPath "System32"
Write-Host $system32Path
# Result: C:\WINDOWS\System32
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows Registry (HKCU: and HKLM:)</strong>
Imagine that the registry is just another file system. Hives are folders, and keys are properties of those folders.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Find out the full name of the installed version of Windows from the registry.
```powershell
# Go to the desired registry hive
Set-Location "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion"

# Get the property (registry value) named "ProductName"
Get-ItemProperty -Path . -Name "ProductName"
# Result: ProductName : Windows 11 Pro
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loaded Functions (Function:)</strong>
Shows all functions available in the current PowerShell session as if they were files.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Find all loaded functions that have the word "Help" in their name and view the code of one of them.
```powershell
# Search for functions by mask
Get-ChildItem Function: | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Help*" }

# Get the full code (definition) of the Get-Help function
(Get-Item Function:Get-Help).Definition
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Variables (Variable:)</strong>
Allows you to manage all variables (`$myVar`, `$PROFILE`, `$Error`, etc.) defined in the current session.</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Find all variables related to the PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable`, `$PSHOME`, etc.).
```powershell
# Find all variables starting with "PS"
Get-ChildItem Variable:PS*

# Get the value of a specific variable
Get-Variable -Name "PSVersionTable"
```</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>2. <strong>Navigation and analysis</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Navigation basics</strong></h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell"># Find out where we are (returns a PathInfo object)
Get-Location          # Aliases: gl, pwd

# Go to the root of the C: drive
Set-Location C:\      # Aliases: sl, cd

# Go to the current user's home folder
Set-Location ~

# Show the contents of the current folder (returns a collection of objects)
Get-ChildItem         # Aliases: gci, ls, dir
</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell"># **Recursive search**
# Find the hosts file on the system, ignoring "Access Denied" errors
Get-ChildItem C:\ -Filter "hosts" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
</code></pre>
<p><strong>`-Recurse` switch (Recursive):</strong> Forces the cmdlet to work not only with the specified item, but also with all its contents.</p>
<p><strong>`-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` switch:</strong> An instruction to ignore errors and continue working silently.</p>
<h5><strong>Disk space analysis</strong></h5>
<p>A classic example of the power of the pipeline: find, sort, format, and select.
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Users -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Sort-Object Length -Descending |
    Select-Object FullName, @{Name="Size(MB)"; Expression={[math]::Round($_.Length/1MB,2)}} |
    Select-Object -First 20
```</p>
<h6><strong>Tip on how to enter long commands.</strong></h6>
<blockquote>
<p>PowerShell allows you to break them into multiple lines for readability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>After the pipeline operator (`|`):</strong> This is the most common and convenient way. Just press `Enter` after the `|` symbol. PowerShell will see that the command is not finished and will wait for continuation on the next line.</li>
<li><strong>Anywhere else:</strong> Use the backtick character (`) at the end of the line, and then press `Enter`. This character tells PowerShell: "The command will continue on the next line".</li>
<li><strong>In editors (ISE, VS Code):</strong> The key combination `Shift+Enter` usually automatically inserts a line break without running the command.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Filtering content and logical operators</strong></h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell"># Find all .exe files. The -Filter parameter works very fast.
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Filter "*.exe"
</code></pre>
<p>`Get-ChildItem` returns a collection of objects. We can pass it through the pipeline to `Where-Object` for further filtering.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell"># Show only files
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows | Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer -eq $false }
</code></pre>
<p>This command introduces us to one of the fundamental concepts in PowerShell scripts: <strong>comparison operators</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Comparison and logical operators</strong></h4>
<p>These are special keys for comparing values. They always start with a hyphen (`-`) and are the basis for filtering data in `Where-Object` and building logic in `if`.</p>

<p>The topic of logical operators is very extensive and I will devote a separate part (or even two) to it. In the meantime, armed with these operators,
we can <strong>filter, sort, and select the files and folders we need</strong>, using the full power of the object pipeline.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples of use in the file system</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Find a file by exact name (case sensitive):</strong>
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\System32 -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "kernel32.dll" }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find all files starting with "host" but not being folders:</strong>
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc | Where-Object { ($_.Name -like "host*") -and (-not $_.PSIsContainer) }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find all log files (.log) larger than 50 megabytes:</strong>
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\Logs -Filter "*.log" -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 50MB }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find all temporary files (.tmp) and backup files (.bak) for cleanup:</strong>
The `-in` operator is much more elegant here than multiple conditions with `-or`.
```powershell
$extensionsToDelete = ".tmp", ".bak", ".old"
Get-ChildItem C:\Temp -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Extension -in $extensionsToDelete }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find all Word files (.docx) created in the last week:</strong>
```powershell
$oneWeekAgo = (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
Get-ChildItem C:\Users\MyUser\Documents -Filter "*.docx" -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.CreationTime -ge $oneWeekAgo }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find empty files (0 bytes in size) that are not folders:</strong>
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Downloads -Recurse | Where-Object { ($_.Length -eq 0) -and (-not $_.PSIsContainer) }
```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find all executable files (.exe) that were modified this year, but NOT this month:</strong>
This complex example demonstrates the power of combining operators.
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files" -Filter "*.exe" -Recurse | Where-Object {
    ($_.LastWriteTime.Year -eq (Get-Date).Year) -and ($_.LastWriteTime.Month -ne (Get-Date).Month)
}
```
<em>(Note: the parentheses `()` around each condition are used for grouping and improving readability, especially in complex cases).</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful with recursion:
Very many files/folders — -Recurse can recursively go into tens of thousands of items.
Symbolic links / circular links — can cause infinite recursion.
Files without access rights — can block execution.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Creating, managing, and safely deleting</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Creating, copying, and moving</strong></h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">New-Item -Path "C:\Temp\MyFolder" -ItemType Directory
Add-Content -Path "C:\Temp\MyFolder\MyFile.txt" -Value "First line"
Copy-Item -Path "C:\Temp\MyFolder" -Destination "C:\Temp\MyFolder_Copy" -Recurse
</code></pre>
<h4><strong>Safe deletion</strong></h4>
<p>`Remove-Item` is a potentially dangerous cmdlet, so PowerShell has built-in protection mechanisms.
> <strong>`-WhatIf` switch (What if?):</strong> Your best friend. It <strong>does not execute</strong> the command, but only outputs a message to the console about <strong>what would have happened</strong>.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell"># Safe CHECK before deleting
Remove-Item C:\Temp\MyFolder -Recurse -Force -WhatIf
# Result: What if: Performing the operation "Remove Directory" on target "C:\Temp\MyFolder".

# Only after making sure everything is correct, we remove -WhatIf and EXECUTE the command
Remove-Item C:\Temp\MyFolder -Recurse -Force
</code></pre>

<h3><strong>Introduction to functions</strong></h3>
<p>When a single line of code turns into a complex set of commands that you want to use over and over again, it's time to create <strong>functions</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>How to use and save functions</strong></h4>
<p>There are three main ways to make your functions available:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Temporary (for testing)</strong>
You can type in the console or just copy and paste the entire function code into the PowerShell console. The function will be available until this window is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Permanent, but manual (via a `.ps1` file)</strong>
This is the most common way to organize and share tools. You save the function to a `.ps1` file and load it into the session when you need it.
> <strong>Dot Sourcing (`. .\script.ps1`):</strong> This special command executes the script in the <em>current</em> context, making all its functions and variables available in your console.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Automatic (via the PowerShell profile)</strong>
This is the most powerful way for your personal, frequently used tools.
> <strong>What is a PowerShell profile?</strong> This is a special `.ps1` script that PowerShell automatically runs every time it starts. Everything you put in this file — aliases, variables, and, of course, functions — will be available in every one of your sessions by default.</p>
<h5><strong>Example 1: Finding duplicate files</strong></h5>
<p>Let's go through all the steps using the `Find-DuplicateFiles` function as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Define the function code</strong>
```powershell
$functionCode = @'
function Find-DuplicateFiles {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Path
    )
    
    Get-ChildItem $Path -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
        Group-Object Name, Length |
        Where-Object { $_.Count -gt 1 } |
        ForEach-Object {
            # THIS IS THE CORRECTED LINE:
            # Inside the $() operator, variables are not escaped.
            Write-Host "Duplicates found: $($_.Name)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
            $_.Group | Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime
        }
}
'@
```</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 (Option A): Save to a separate file for manual loading</strong>
```powershell
# Save
Set-Content -Path ".\Find-DuplicateFiles.ps1" -Value $functionCode
# Load
. .\Find-DuplicateFiles.ps1
```
> Dot Sourcing (. .\Find-DuplicateFiles.ps1): This special command executes the script in the current context, making all its functions and variables available in your console.
```powershell
# Call
Find-DuplicateFiles -Path "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Downloads"
```</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 (Option B): Add to the profile for automatic loading</strong>
Let's make this function always available.
>What is a PowerShell profile? This is a special .ps1 script that PowerShell automatically runs every time it starts. Everything you put in this file — aliases, variables, and functions — will be available in every one of your sessions by default.
1.  <strong>Find the path to the profile file.</strong> PowerShell stores it in the `$PROFILE` variable.
    ```powershell
    $PROFILE
    ```
2.  <strong>Create the profile file if it doesn't exist.</strong>
    ```powershell
    if (-not (Test-Path $PROFILE)) {
        New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
    }
    ```
3.  <strong>Add the code of our function to the end of the profile file.</strong>
    ```powershell
    Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value $functionCode
    ```
4.  <strong>Restart PowerShell</strong> (or run `. $PROFILE`), and now your `Find-DuplicateFiles` command will always be available, just like `Get-ChildItem`.</p>
<h5><strong>Example 2: Creating a ZIP archive with a backup copy</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Code for the `Backup-FolderToZip.ps1` file:</strong>
```powershell
function Backup-FolderToZip {
    param([string]$SourcePath, [string]$DestinationPath)
    if (-not (Test-Path $SourcePath)) { Write-Error "Source folder not found."; return }
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm"
    $archiveFileName = "Backup_{0}_{1}.zip" -f (Split-Path $SourcePath -Leaf), $timestamp
    $fullArchivePath = Join-Path $DestinationPath $archiveFileName
    if (-not (Test-Path $DestinationPath)) { New-Item -Path $DestinationPath -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null }
    Compress-Archive -Path "$SourcePath\*" -DestinationPath $fullArchivePath -Force
    Write-Host "Backup completed: $fullArchivePath" -ForegroundColor Green
}
```</p>
<p>I will do a detailed analysis of the functions in the following parts.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Need to <strong>read the contents</strong> of a text file? Use `Get-Content`.
Need to <strong>completely overwrite a file</strong> with new content? Use `Set-Content`.
Need to <strong>add a line to a log file</strong> without erasing the old data? Use `Add-Content`.
Need to <strong>check if a file exists</strong> before writing? Use `Test-Path`.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Specialized cmdlets for advanced tasks</strong></h4>
<p>When basic cmdlets are not enough, PowerShell offers more specialized tools. They do not duplicate the basic ones, but expand your capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Working with paths (Path)</strong>
*   <strong>`Join-Path`</strong>: Safely joins parts of a path, automatically inserting `\`.
*   <strong>`Split-Path`</strong>: Splits a path into parts (folder, file name, extension).
*   <strong>`Resolve-Path`</strong>: Converts a relative path (e.g., `.` or `..\files`) to a full, absolute path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working with properties and content (Item Properties and Content)</strong>
*   <strong>`Get-ItemProperty`</strong>: Gets the properties of a specific file (e.g., `IsReadOnly`, `CreationTime`).
*   <strong>`Set-ItemProperty`</strong>: Changes the properties of a file or folder.
*   <strong>`Clear-Content`</strong>: Deletes all content from a file, but leaves the file itself empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced navigation (Location Stack)</strong>
*   <strong>`Push-Location`</strong>: "Remembers" the current directory and goes to a new one.
*   <strong>`Pop-Location`</strong>: Returns to the directory that `Push-Location` "remembered".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access control management (ACL)</strong>
*   <strong>`Get-Acl`</strong>: Gets the access control list (ACL) for a file or folder.
*   <strong>`Set-Acl`</strong>: Sets the access control list for a file or folder (a complex operation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to <strong>change a file attribute</strong>, for example, make it "read-only"? Use `Set-ItemProperty`.
Need to <strong>completely clear a log file</strong> without deleting it? Use `Clear-Content`.
Need to <strong>temporarily go to another folder</strong> in a script, and then be guaranteed to go back? Use `Push-Location` and `Pop-Location`.
Need to <strong>find out who has rights</strong> to access a folder? Use `Get-Acl`.</p>
<p>In the next part, we will learn how to work with other data stores, such as the Windows registry,
using the same approaches, delve into the concept of functions, consider logical operators, and learn how to interact with the shell interactively</p>
