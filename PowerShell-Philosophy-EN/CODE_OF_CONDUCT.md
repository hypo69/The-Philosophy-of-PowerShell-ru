# Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct).

## My Commitments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the author of this project, I pledge to make participation in it a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment within this project.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those who are affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
*   Focusing on what is best for the project and its community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## My Responsibilities for Enforcement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to me at **hypo69@davidka.net**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Consequences of Violations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will follow these principles in determining consequences:

1.  **Correction:** For a minor violation, I may require a public apology or issue a private warning.
2.  **Warning:** For a violation through a single incident or a series of actions, a warning may be issued with consequences specified if the unacceptable behavior continues.
3.  **Temporary Ban:** For a serious violation of community standards, a temporary ban from any interaction with the project for a specified period of time may follow.
4.  **Permanent Ban:** For demonstrating systematic violations of standards, harassment, or aggressive behavior, a participant may be permanently excluded from the project.
