# The Philosophy of PowerShell

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this series is not to create another cmdlet reference. 
The key idea that I will be developing throughout all chapters is the transition from thinking in text to **thinking in objects**. 
Instead of working with unstructured strings, I will teach you how to operate with full-fledged objects with their properties and methods, 
passing them through the pipeline, like on an assembly line in a factory.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series will help you go beyond simply writing commands and acquire a conscious engineering approach to PowerShell,
as a powerful tool for dissecting the operating system.
