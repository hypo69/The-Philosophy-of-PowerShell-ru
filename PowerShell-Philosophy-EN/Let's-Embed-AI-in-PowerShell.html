<h1>Let's Embed AI in PowerShell</h1>
<h4><strong>What is Gemini CLI?</strong></h4>
<p>I have already talked in detail about <strong>Gemini CLI</strong> in <a href="https://pikabu.ru/series/geminicli_48168">Gemini CLI: Introduction and First Steps</a>. But if you missed it, here's a brief introduction.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>Gemini CLI</strong> is a command-line interface for interacting with Google's AI models. You launch it in your terminal, and it turns into a chat that, unlike web versions, has access to your file system.</p>
<p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understands code:</strong> It can analyze your scripts, find errors in them, and suggest fixes.</li>
<li><strong>Generates code:</strong> You can ask it to write a PowerShell script to solve your problem, and it will.</li>
<li><strong>Works with files:</strong> Can read files, create new ones, and make changes to existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Runs commands:</strong> Can execute shell commands, such as <code>git</code> or <code>npm</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our purposes, the most important thing is that Gemini CLI can work in <strong>non-interactive mode</strong>. That is, we can pass it a prompt as a command-line argument, and it will simply return a response, without launching its interactive chat. This is precisely the capability we will use.</p>
<h4><strong>Installation and Setup</strong></h4>
<p>To get started, we need to prepare our environment. This is done once.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Node.js</strong>
Gemini CLI is an application written in Node.js (a popular environment for JavaScript). So first, we need to install Node.js itself.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the official website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a></li>
<li>Download and install the <strong>LTS</strong> version. This is the most stable and recommended option. Just follow the installer instructions.</li>
<li>After installation, open a new PowerShell window and check that everything is working:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">node -v
npm -v
</code></pre>
<p>You should see versions, for example, <code>v20.12.2</code> and <code>10.5.0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2: Install Gemini CLI itself</strong>
Now that we have <code>npm</code> (the package manager for Node.js), installing Gemini CLI comes down to one command. Run it in PowerShell:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-g</code> flag means "global installation," which will make the <code>gemini</code> command available from anywhere on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Authentication</strong>
The first time you launch Gemini CLI, it will ask you to sign in to your Google account. This is necessary so that it can use your free quota.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply enter the command in PowerShell:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">gemini
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>It will ask you about signing in. Select "Sign in with Google."</li>
<li>Your browser will open a standard Google sign-in window. Sign in to your account and grant the necessary permissions.</li>
<li>After that, you will see a welcome message from Gemini in the console. Congratulations, you are ready to work! You can type <code>/quit</code> to exit its chat.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>PowerShell Philosophy: The Terrible <code>Invoke-Expression</code></strong></h4>
<p>Before we put everything together, let's get acquainted with one of the most dangerous cmdlets in PowerShell — <code>Invoke-Expression</code>, or its short alias <code>iex</code>.</p>
<p><code>Invoke-Expression</code> takes a text string and executes it as if it were a command typed in the console.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">$commandString = "Get-Process -Name 'chrome'"
Invoke-Expression -InputObject $commandString
</code></pre>
<p>This command will do the same as a simple call to <code>Get-Process -Name 'chrome'</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it dangerous?</strong> Because executing a string that you do not control (for example, obtained from the Internet or from AI) is a huge security hole. If the AI mistakenly or maliciously returns the command <code>Remove-Item -Path C:\ -Recurse -Force</code>, <code>iex</code> will execute it without hesitation.</p>
<p>For our task—creating a managed and controlled bridge between a natural language query and its execution—it is perfectly suited. We will use it with caution, fully aware of the risks.</p>
<h4><strong>Putting it all together: The <code>Invoke-Gemini</code> Cmdlet</strong></h4>
<p>Let's write a simple PowerShell function that will allow us to send prompts with a single command.</p>
<p>Copy this code and paste it into your PowerShell window so that it becomes available in the current session.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">function Invoke-Gemini {
    &lt;#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Sends a text prompt to Gemini CLI and returns its response.
    #&gt;
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 0, ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
        [string]$Prompt
    )

    process {
        try {
            # Check if the gemini command is available
            $geminiCommand = Get-Command gemini -ErrorAction Stop
        }
        catch {
            Write-Error "The 'gemini' command was not found. Make sure Gemini CLI is installed."
            return
        }

        Write-Verbose "Sending prompt to Gemini CLI..."
        
        # Run gemini in non-interactive mode with our prompt
        $output = &amp; $geminiCommand.Source -p $Prompt 2&gt;&amp;1

        if (-not $?) {
            Write-Warning "The gemini command finished with an error."
            $output | ForEach-Object { Write-Warning $_.ToString() }
            return
        }

        # Return clean output
        return $output
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4><strong>Let's try the magic!</strong></h4>
<p>Let's ask it a general question directly from our PowerShell console.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-powershell">Invoke-Gemini -Prompt "Tell me about the five latest trends in machine learning"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have just successfully embedded AI in PowerShell.</p>
<p>In the next article, I will tell you how to use Gemini CLI to run scripts and automate tasks.</p>
