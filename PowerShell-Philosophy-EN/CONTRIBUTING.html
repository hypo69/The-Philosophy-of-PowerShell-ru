<h1>How to Contribute to the PowerShell Philosophy Project</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is hypo69, and I am the author and sole developer of this project. I created it because I want to make PowerShell more accessible and understandable for everyone.</p>
<p>Although I primarily develop it myself, I greatly appreciate the community's interest and would be happy to receive your help. To ensure our collaboration is effective and pleasant for everyone, I have put together this small guide.</p>
<p>Before you begin, please read the <a href="CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. I want our communication to be respectful and constructive.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Rule</h2>
<p>Since I maintain the project alone, my time is limited. Therefore, please <strong>create an Issue before you start writing code</strong> so we can discuss your proposal. [3, 8] This will help ensure that your idea aligns with the project's vision and will save both of us a lot of time.</p>
<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>I would be especially grateful for help in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding and describing errors (bugs).</strong> If something isn't working as expected, let me know.</li>
<li><strong>Suggestions for improvement.</strong> Have an idea how to make the project better? Great, let's discuss it in Issues.</li>
<li><strong>Improving documentation.</strong> Found a typo, inaccuracy, or think a section could be explained more clearly? Edits to the documentation are a great way to help!</li>
<li><strong>Writing code.</strong> Help with implementing new features or fixing bugs is always welcome, but please remember the "most important rule" above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contribution Process</h2>
<h3>1. Discussion (Issues)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Bugs:</strong> Go to the <a href="https://github.com/hypo69/The-Philosophy-of-PowerShell-ru/issues">Issues</a> section and check if anyone has reported your problem before. If not, create a new issue with a detailed description:
<ul>
<li>Steps to reproduce the bug.</li>
<li>What you expected to get.</li>
<li>What you actually got.</li>
<li>If possible, information about your environment (OS version, program version, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For New Ideas (Features):</strong> Create a new issue and describe your idea. Explain what problem it solves and why it would be useful.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Making Changes (Pull Requests)</h3>
<p>Once we agree on an idea in Issues, you can start coding.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fork</strong> this repository.</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong> your fork to your computer.</li>
<li><strong>Create a new branch</strong> for your changes (e.g., <code>git checkout -b fix/fix-button</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Write code.</strong> Try to adhere to the coding style already used in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Commit.</strong> Write clear commit messages, for example: <code>fix: Fixed authorization error with empty password</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong> your changes to your fork on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Pull Request</strong> to my repository. In the description, briefly explain what you did, and be sure to include the Issue number you are addressing (e.g., <code>Closes #42</code>).</li>
</ol>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I will try to review your contribution as soon as possible. Remember that this is my personal project, and I may have other commitments, so sometimes a response may take some time.</p>
<p>In any case, thank you very much for your time and for wanting to make this project better!</p>
