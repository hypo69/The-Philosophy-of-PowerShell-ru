# How to Contribute to the PowerShell Philosophy Project

Hi! My name is hypo69, and I am the author and sole developer of this project. I created it because I want to make PowerShell more accessible and understandable for everyone.

Although I primarily develop it myself, I greatly appreciate the community's interest and would be happy to receive your help. To ensure our collaboration is effective and pleasant for everyone, I have put together this small guide.

Before you begin, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). I want our communication to be respectful and constructive.

## The Most Important Rule

Since I maintain the project alone, my time is limited. Therefore, please **create an Issue before you start writing code** so we can discuss your proposal. [3, 8] This will help ensure that your idea aligns with the project's vision and will save both of us a lot of time.

## How can you help?

I would be especially grateful for help in the following areas:

*   **Finding and describing errors (bugs).** If something isn't working as expected, let me know.
*   **Suggestions for improvement.** Have an idea how to make the project better? Great, let's discuss it in Issues.
*   **Improving documentation.** Found a typo, inaccuracy, or think a section could be explained more clearly? Edits to the documentation are a great way to help!
*   **Writing code.** Help with implementing new features or fixing bugs is always welcome, but please remember the "most important rule" above.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Discussion (Issues)

*   **For Bugs:** Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/hypo69/The-Philosophy-of-PowerShell-ru/issues) section and check if anyone has reported your problem before. If not, create a new issue with a detailed description:
    *   Steps to reproduce the bug.
    *   What you expected to get.
    *   What you actually got.
    *   If possible, information about your environment (OS version, program version, etc.).
*   **For New Ideas (Features):** Create a new issue and describe your idea. Explain what problem it solves and why it would be useful.

### 2. Making Changes (Pull Requests)

Once we agree on an idea in Issues, you can start coding.

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your computer.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b fix/fix-button`).
4.  **Write code.** Try to adhere to the coding style already used in the project.
5.  **Commit.** Write clear commit messages, for example: `fix: Fixed authorization error with empty password`.
6.  **Push** your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7.  **Create a Pull Request** to my repository. In the description, briefly explain what you did, and be sure to include the Issue number you are addressing (e.g., `Closes #42`).

## What's next?

I will try to review your contribution as soon as possible. Remember that this is my personal project, and I may have other commitments, so sometimes a response may take some time.

In any case, thank you very much for your time and for wanting to make this project better!
